# Rock-Paper-Scissor
It is a common game, we all know it. I have made it a CLI based game and for the fairness of the game, you cannot see the input you just texted. There are 2 players in this game and no one will know what the other one chose

# 🎮 Rock Paper Scissors – Terminal Game

This is a simple and fun two-player Rock, Paper, Scissors game that you can play directly from your Command Prompt or Terminal!

## ✨ Features

- 🪨📄✂️ Classic Rock, Paper, Scissors gameplay
- 🔒 Fairness: Players cannot see each other's input (hidden typing)
- 🖥️ Run in real Command Prompt or Terminal
- 🎨 Colorful output with emojis

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Open **Command Prompt** (on Windows) or **Terminal** (on Mac/Linux)
2. Get inside the game folder
3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python rps_game.py

**Each player takes turns to secretly type their move (R, P, or S) — the input is hidden, so it's fair!

After both players enter their move, the result is shown (win/lose/tie).**

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.x installed
- Works best in:
  - Command Prompt (Windows)
  - PowerShell
  - Terminal (Mac/Linux)

> **❗Note: This game uses `getpass` to hide input, which might not work inside IDEs like VS Code. Use the terminal instead for best results!**
